# About
> This 2D game is part of a experimental set of educational games built in godot engine using gdscript language. (like python)  
> You can play a tetris game solving many forms of math operations.

# Features
> - The game will be fully refactored and few bugs will be fixed.
> - The game can be played in English or Portuguese.
> - In development mode you can set the starting score or skip to any level.
> - The initial page contains the basic instructions for the game. (see layouts below)
> - In the first row, a randomly generated number moves horizontally.
> - In the second line, the above quoted number can be changed for some of the symbols or it can be added or subtracted by one in the symbols '>' and '<' respectively. (Play! It is very intuitive and fun.)
> - - -
> - The game has thirteen different levels:
> - 1. Compare two integers.
> - 2. Compare equals Arabic and Roman numerals and vice versa.
> - 3. Solve the addition of two integers.
> - 4. Solve the subtraction of two integers.
> - 5. Solve the mix of adding, subtracting operations.
> - 6. Solve the multiplication of two integers.
> - 7. Solve the division of two integers.
> - 8. Compare two fractions.
> - 9. Solve the rest of integer division.
> - 10. Solve the mix of adding, subtracting and multiplying operations.
> - 11. Same as above but you can use parentheses.
> - 12. Solve the mix of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations, you can use parentheses.
> - 13. Solve the mix of all the above operations.  



# Layouts
> ## The homepage with basic instructions.  
> - The initial number to be factored is randonomicaly generated.

# Models
> - Godot embraces object-oriented design at its core with its flexible scene system and Node hierarchy.
> - Tree of nodes (node: smallest building blocks) that you group together into scenes. 
> - Nodes communication each other by signals. 
> - A Script in GDScript language is a class that extend (inherit) a node class or you can create a new original one class.

# Tecnologies
> - Godot engine 2.1.4
>     - http://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/2.1.4/
> - GDScript (like python)

# Kick off
> - Download the engine and the game.
> - Start godot engine and import the engine.cfg in the root directory of the game.
> - Run in dev mode or compile (export) for android, ios, windows, linux, etc.
